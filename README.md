# SQL_Books

Create a program that can be used by a bookstore clerk. The program
should allow the clerk to:

○ enter new books into the database

○ update book information

○ delete books from the database

○ search the database to ﬁnd a speciﬁc book.

Populate the table with the above values. You can also add your own
values if you wish.

The program should present the user with the following menu:
1. Enter book
2. Update book
3. Delete book
4. Search books
0. Exit
The program should perform the function that the user selects. The
implementation of these functions is left up to you.

Feel free to add more functionality and complexity to the program. This is
your chance to show off all the programming concepts you have learnt so
far!
